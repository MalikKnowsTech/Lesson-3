-Greater than or less than symbols: &lt &gt
-Communicate emphasis using: <em> makes text italicized (good for text to speech programs as well such as AWS Polly)
-make text BOLD using: <str ong>
-Create lines across the webpage using horizontal rules: <h r>
-Create text breaks using <b r
-Finally, how to comment in html: <!-- > (*Note others can view your commented code on a live page by inspecting source code; USE DISCRETION

*Commenting in html is more work than in Python, but typing "strings" is more simple in html.
